### Abstract
In practical applications, studies often focus on analyzing the time until an event of interest occurs, particularly when time-dependent covariates are involved. This paper presents a joint survival and binary longitudinal data analysis model to examine how changes in longitudinal data influence the risk of death among elderly patients while accounting for binary outcomes related to life satisfaction over time. The maximum likelihood estimator is obtained through a two-stage approach: in the first stage, predicted individual mean trajectories are derived from a generalized linear mixed model; in the second stage, these predicted individual mean values are treated as time-dependent covariates in the Cox proportional hazards model. The paper also applies the Jackknife and Bootstrap methods to correct for the bias in the maximum likelihood estimator introduced by numerical approximations in the first stage. Additionally, we propose residual diagnostics to identify potential departures from the model and detect outliers observations. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate the empirical distributions of Martingale, randomized quantile, deviance, NRSP, and NMSP residuals. Finally, the Taiwan Elderly Dataset is used to evaluate the proposed method.
